/// A dynamic camera that can follow cars with smooth transitions
///
/// The Camera struct represents a viewpoint in the game world, defining both position
/// and orientation. It supports dynamic following behavior with smooth transitions,
/// making it ideal for racing games. The camera adjusts its height and pitch based
/// on the car's speed, providing better visibility at higher speeds.
///
/// Camera parameters include:
/// * Position (x, y)
/// * Height above ground
/// * Viewing angle (yaw)
/// * Pitch (tilt down angle)
/// * Near/far clipping planes
/// * Scale factor
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let mut camera = Camera::new(0.0, 0.0, 15.0, 0.0);
///
/// // In game loop:
/// camera.follow_car(&player_car, delta_time);
/// renderer.render(&camera);
/// ```

    /// Updates camera position and orientation to smoothly follow a car
    ///
    /// This method implements a dynamic camera system that follows a car with smooth
    /// transitions. It adjusts multiple camera parameters based on the car's state:
    ///
    /// * Position: Smoothly moves toward a position behind the car
    /// * Angle: Gradually rotates to match the car's direction
    /// * Height: Increases with car speed for better visibility
    /// * Pitch: Adjusts to look further ahead at higher speeds
    ///
    /// The camera's movement is controlled by several constants:
    /// * FOLLOW_DISTANCE: Distance to maintain behind the car (0.0 for centered)
    /// * CAMERA_LERP: Position and height transition speed (5.0)
    /// * ANGLE_LERP: Rotation transition speed (3.0)
    ///
    /// The method uses linear interpolation (lerp) for smooth transitions, with
    /// the interpolation factor scaled by delta time for frame-rate independence.
